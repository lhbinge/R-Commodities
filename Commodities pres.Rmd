#Introduction

## The South African Art Market

Surge in popularity of Modern and Contemporary South African art 

Huge increase in prices in run-up to Great Recession   

Record prices at international and local auctions   

- Irma Stern's *"Arab Priest"* sold for £2.7m in 2011 Bonhams in London 
- Irma Stern's *"Two Arabs"* sold for R19m by Strauss & Co

Prompted many claims of a "bubble"" in the art market   
  
Objectives:  

1) Construct indicators of art market prices over time
2) Test for a "bubble" in the SA art market
